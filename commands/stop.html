    <p><code>stop</code> subcommand used to stop one or more VMs.</p>

    <pre>
$ vermin stop vm_01
<graycode>âœ” Stopping vm_01</graycode>
    </pre>

    <p>
      Once a VM stopped, you cannot use the
      <link-ssh></link-ssh>
      command to ssh into the VM.
    </p>

    <p>
      To stop more than one VM, pass them space separated on the command line:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ vermin stop vm_01 vm_02
    </pre>

    <p>
      If you tried to stop an already stopped VM, you will got a message indicating that, as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ vermin stop vm_01
<graycode>VM already stopped, use "vermin start vm_01" to start the VM.</graycode>
    </pre>

    <p>
      You can make sure the VM is stopped by using the
      <link-ps></link-ps>
      command.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can always
      <link-start></link-start>
      a stopped VM.
    </p>

    <h5>Listing stopped VMs</h5>
    We will cover this topic in greater details in the
    <link-ps></link-ps>
    section. but for now you need to know that
    the <code>ps</code> command can list all VMs either running or stopped.
