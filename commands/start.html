    <p><code>start</code> subcommand used to start one or more VMs.</p>

    <pre>
$ vermin start vm_01
<graycode>✔ Starting vm_01
✔ Establishing connection</graycode>
    </pre>

    <p>
      Then you can use the
      <link-ssh></link-ssh>
      command to ssh into the VM.
    </p>

    <p>
      To start more than one VM, pass them space separated on the command line:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ vermin start vm_01 vm_02
    </pre>

    <p>
      If you tried to start an already started VM, you will got a message indicating that, as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ vermin start vm_01
<graycode>VM already running, use "vermin ssh vm_01" to ssh into the VM.</graycode>
    </pre>

    <p>
      You can also
      <link-restart></link-restart>
      or
      <link-stop></link-stop>
      a running VM.
    </p>

    <h5>Listing started VMs</h5>
    We will cover this topic in greater details in the
    <link-ps></link-ps>
    section. but for now you need to know that
    the <code>ps</code> command by default lists the started and already running VMs.
